## Goal

The goal of this is to get comfortable with thinking about the state of the app and updating the Views accordingly. In addition, will be using logic to control the flow of the program. This is a challenge where solidify understanding of IF-ELSE statements and comparison operators.

## What is created

Be creating a “choose your own adventure” game similar to the App Store hit “Life Line” app. The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience
